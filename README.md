# JavaScript Design Patterns: Exercise - Cat clicking app using Knockout.

This exercise is part of Udacity's JavaScript Design Patterns course. The objective of this exercise,
like the CatClicker repo, https://github.com/peretz/CatClicker, is learning the basic concepts around
organizing scalable and maintainable code using organizational libraries and frameworks. This includes:

* *Universal organizational concepts* in libraries and frameworks.
* *Bindings, Automatic UI refresh and dependency tracking.*
* Knockouts Model-View-ViewModel pattern.
* *Observables, observableArrays, computedObservables, etc.*

We achieve this by implementing a cat clicking app using the knockout library.

## File Structure.

There are two main files:

* *index.hmtl:* Contains a generic structure of the website.
* *app.js:* Contains the Model and ViewModel code and data.

## Displaying the app in your browser

1. Open the index.html file in your browser (e.g. file://your-local-path/index.html).
